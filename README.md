DogGram application works and looks a lot like Instagram. 

I used SwiftUI as the front end to create the scenes, and Google Firebase as the back end to store the app data.

This is a full app where users can actually sign in and create accounts.

The app has a feed page where users can like and comment on each other posts,
has a browse page where users can discover new posts,
has a tab to upload posts to the database,
and of course has personal profiles where users can customise their display name, bio and profile picture.

In total the app has over 15 screens, plus a whole bunch of sub-views and sub-screens, and it has custom animations and segues to navigate around the app.
