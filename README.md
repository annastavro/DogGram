\f0\fs24 \cf0 DogGram application works and looks a lot like Instagram. \
I used SwiftUI as the front end to create the scenes, and Google Firebase as the back end to store the app data.\
This is a full app where users can actually sign in and create accounts.\
The app has a feed page where users can like and comment on each other posts,\
has a browse page where users can discover new posts,\
has a tab to upload posts to the database,\
and of course has personal profiles where users can customise their display name, bio and profile picture.\
\
In total the app has over 15 screens, plus a whole bunch of sub-views and sub-screens, and it has custom animations and segues to navigate around the app.\
